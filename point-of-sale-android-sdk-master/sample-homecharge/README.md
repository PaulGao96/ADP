## Home Charge

To build this sample app, follow the same instructions as for the sample app in the main README, substituting "hellocharge" for "homecharge".

You'll need to set up Firebase for this project. Go to the [Firebase Controle](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a new project, go into the Console settings to add a new Android App (package: com.example.homecharge), download google-services.json and move it to the sample-homecharge folder.

You can deploy the AppEngine server in Android Studio with Build > Deploy Module to App Engine.
